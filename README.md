# Photocatalyst_NN

Photocatalysis is a rapidly developing area of chemistry, in which the creation of new substances capable of converting the energy of visible light into reaction energy is a fundamental task.
Classical approaches based on human intuition are often quite complex, and quantum mechanical calculations of the photodynamic properties of molecules are cumbersome and time-consuming.Machine learning approach time consisiting problem, but that work only for organic compound. Our repositories introduce python notebooks and fine-tubbed models, that can predict photodynamics properties like a absorprion, emission wavelength and quantum yield of fluorescence not only organic compounds, but metalloroganic and metalorganic complex.
